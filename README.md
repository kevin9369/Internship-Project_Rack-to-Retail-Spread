# Internship-Project_Rack-to-Retail-Spread
1. This project aims to establish a rack to retail spread tool to decide which markets would be profitable for selling CFN cards. This tool will serve as an important indicator for conventional sales and for providing insights needed to decide pricing for all markets.
2. I created a mapping table and put the mapping table in data warehouse.
3. I wrote the SQL code to join three datasets and retrieve data, and created a view in Snowflake by using Alteryx.
4.  I connected Snowflake to Tableau to do data visualization and data analysis.
